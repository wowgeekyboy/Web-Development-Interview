# üöÄ React.js Interview Questions and Answers

## Advanced Questions

### 1. What is the difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`? ü§î

Both `useMemo` and `useCallback` are hooks used for optimization in React, but they serve slightly different purposes.

**Novice Explanation:** Imagine you have two magic spell books üìö. `useMemo` is a spell that remembers the result of a complex calculation, while `useCallback` is a spell that remembers a function you've created. Both help you avoid doing unnecessary work.

**Expert Explanation:** 
- `useMemo` is used to memoize **values**. It recalculates the memoized value only when one of the dependencies has changed.
- `useCallback` is used to memoize **functions**. It returns a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.

Key differences:
1. `useMemo` returns a memoized value, `useCallback` returns a memoized function.
2. `useMemo` is used for expensive calculations, `useCallback` is used to optimize child component re-renders when passing callbacks.
3. `useMemo` runs during rendering, `useCallback` doesn't run the function, it just memoizes it.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useState, useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';

function ParentComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [otherState, setOtherState] = useState(0);

  // useMemo example
  const expensiveResult = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Calculating expensive result...');
    return count * 1000;
  }, [count]);

  // useCallback example
  const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Calling callback, count is', count);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Expensive Result: {expensiveResult}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <button onClick={() => setOtherState(otherState + 1)}>Change Other State</button>
      <ChildComponent callback={memoizedCallback} />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ callback }) {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <button onClick={callback}>Call Parent Callback</button>;
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

In this example, `useMemo` is used to memoize an expensive calculation, while `useCallback` is used to memoize a callback function passed to a child component.

### 2. What is the purpose of the `useRef` hook? üéØ

The `useRef` hook is used to create a mutable reference that persists across re-renders of a component.

**Novice Explanation:** Think of `useRef` like a sticky note üìù that you can attach to your component. You can write something on it, and it'll still be there even if your component refreshes or changes.

**Expert Explanation:** `useRef` returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument. The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

Key use cases:
1. Storing mutable values that don't cause re-renders when updated.
2. Accessing DOM elements directly.
3. Storing previous values in functional components.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  const inputEl = useRef(null);
  const [renderCount, setRenderCount] = useState(0);
  const prevRenderCount = useRef();

  const onButtonClick = () => {
    // `current` points to the mounted text input element
    inputEl.current.focus();
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    prevRenderCount.current = renderCount;
  });

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
      <button onClick={() => setRenderCount(renderCount + 1)}>Re-render</button>
      <p>Current render count: {renderCount}</p>
      <p>Previous render count: {prevRenderCount.current}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useRef` is used both to access a DOM element (the input) and to store a previous value (render count) that persists across re-renders.

### 3. How do you implement routing in a React application? üõ£Ô∏è

Routing in React is typically implemented using a library like React Router, which provides a declarative way to define the routing structure of your application.

**Novice Explanation:** Imagine your app is a house üè† with many rooms. Routing is like creating a map of the house, deciding which doors lead to which rooms, and figuring out how to move between them.

**Expert Explanation:** React Router is the most popular library for routing in React applications. It allows you to define routes as React components, making it easy to create single-page applications with dynamic, client-side routing.

Key concepts:
1. `BrowserRouter`: Wraps your app and enables routing.
2. `Route`: Defines a mapping between a URL path and a React component.
3. `Link`: Creates navigation links in your application.
4. `Switch`: Renders the first matching route exclusively.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

function Home() {
  return <h2>Home</h2>;
}

function About() {
  return <h2>About</h2>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/about">About</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        <Switch>
          <Route path="/about">
            <About />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/">
            <Home />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This example sets up basic routing with two routes: a home page and an about page.

### 4. What are React Server Components? üñ•Ô∏è

React Server Components are a new feature that allows components to be rendered on the server, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client and improving performance.

**Novice Explanation:** Imagine you're ordering a pizza üçï. With normal React, you get all the ingredients and have to assemble and cook the pizza yourself. With Server Components, you get a fully cooked pizza - your browser just needs to warm it up and serve it.

**Expert Explanation:** React Server Components allow developers to build apps that span the server and client, combining the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering.

Key points:
1. Server Components run on the server and can access server-side resources directly.
2. They can be mixed with traditional client-side React components.
3. They help reduce bundle size by keeping server-only code on the server.
4. They improve initial page load and first contentful paint.

**Example:**
```jsx
// Note: This syntax is experimental and subject to change

// ServerComponent.js
import db from 'database'; // This import only exists on the server

async function ServerComponent({ query }) {
  const data = await db.query(query);
  return <div>{data.map(item => <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>)}</div>;
}

// App.js
import ServerComponent from './ServerComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <ServerComponent query="SELECT * FROM users" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `ServerComponent` runs on the server, fetches data from a database, and renders the result. The client receives the rendered HTML without needing to download or execute the database query code.

### 5. How do you manage state in a React application? üóÉÔ∏è

State management in React can be handled through various approaches, depending on the complexity and scale of your application.

**Novice Explanation:** Managing state in React is like organizing a big library üìö. For a small library, you might just remember where everything is. But for a big library, you need a system to keep track of all the books and where they belong.

**Expert Explanation:** React offers several built-in ways to manage state, and there are also third-party libraries for more complex state management needs.

State management options:
1. **Local component state**: Using `useState` hook or `this.state` in class components.
2. **Lifting state up**: Moving state to a common ancestor for sharing between components.
3. **Context API**: For passing data through the component tree without explicitly passing props.
4. **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
5. **MobX**: Simple, scalable state management.
6. **Recoil**: A state management library for React developed by Facebook.

**Example using Context API and useReducer:**
```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from 'react';

// Create a context
const CountContext = createContext();

// Reducer function
function countReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action.type}`);
  }
}

// Provider component
function CountProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(countReducer, { count: 0 });
  return (
    <CountContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </CountContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Hook for using the count context
function useCount() {
  const context = useContext(CountContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useCount must be used within a CountProvider');
  }
  return context;
}

// Example usage
function Counter() {
  const { state, dispatch } = useCount();
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <CountProvider>
      <Counter />
    </CountProvider>
  );
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple state management setup using the Context API and `useReducer` hook, which can be effective for medium-sized applications.

### 6. What is Redux and how does it integrate with React? üîÑ

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, commonly used with React for managing complex application states.

**Novice Explanation:** Imagine you're running a big restaurant üçΩÔ∏è. Redux is like having a central kitchen where all dishes are prepared (state is managed) and then distributed to different tables (components). This ensures that everyone gets the right dish and makes it easier to manage the whole restaurant.

**Expert Explanation:** Redux provides a centralized store for state management, which can be especially useful in large applications with complex state interactions. It follows three main principles:

1. Single source of truth: The entire state of the application is stored in a single store.
2. State is read-only: The only way to change state is to emit an action.
3. Changes are made with pure functions: Reducers are pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state.

Key concepts in Redux:
- Store: Holds the state of the application
- Actions: Plain JavaScript objects describing what happened
- Reducers: Pure functions specifying how the state changes in response to actions
- Dispatch: Method to send actions to the store

**Example:**
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { Provider, useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

// Reducer
const counterReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Store
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// Counter Component
function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// App Component
function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Counter />
    </Provider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, Redux is used to manage a simple counter state. The `Provider` component makes the Redux store available to the entire app, while `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks are used to access the state and dispatch actions respectively.

### 7. What are some common performance pitfalls in React applications? üê¢

Performance issues in React can arise from various sources, and identifying and addressing these is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience.

**Novice Explanation:** Think of your React app as a car üöó. Just like a car can slow down due to various reasons like low tire pressure or a clogged air filter, a React app can slow down due to things like unnecessary re-renders or large bundle sizes.

**Expert Explanation:** Common performance issues in React applications include:

1. **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Components re-rendering when their props or state haven't actually changed.
2. **Large Bundle Sizes**: Sending too much JavaScript to the client, increasing load times.
3. **Unoptimized Images**: Large images that aren't properly sized or compressed.
4. **Excessive API Calls**: Making too many API calls or not caching results effectively.
5. **Inefficient List Rendering**: Rendering large lists without virtualization.
6. **Memory Leaks**: Not cleaning up subscriptions or timers in useEffect.

Strategies to address these issues:

1. Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
2. Implement code splitting using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
3. Optimize images using proper formats, sizes, and lazy loading.
4. Implement efficient data fetching strategies, like caching and pagination.
5. Use virtualization for long lists (e.g., react-window or react-virtualized).
6. Properly clean up side effects in useEffect.

**Example of optimizing a list render:**
```jsx
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

function App() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => ({ id: i, text: `Item ${i}` })));

  const Row = useMemo(() => ({ index, style }) => (
    <div style={style}>
      {items[index].text}
    </div>
  ), [items]);

  return (
    <List
      height={400}
      itemCount={items.length}
      itemSize={35}
      width={300}
    >
      {Row}
    </List>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This example uses `react-window` to efficiently render a large list, and `useMemo` to optimize the row component.

### 8. How do you implement error boundaries in React? üõ°Ô∏è

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

**Novice Explanation:** Error boundaries are like safety nets üï∏Ô∏è in a circus. If an acrobat (a component) falls (crashes), the safety net (error boundary) catches them and prevents the whole show (app) from stopping.

**Expert Explanation:** Error boundaries work like a JavaScript `catch {}` block, but for components. They are class components that define a `static getDerivedStateFromError()` and/or `componentDidCatch()` lifecycle method.

Key points:
1. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.
2. They do not catch errors inside event handlers.
3. As of React 16, errors that were not caught by any error boundary will result in unmounting of the whole React component tree.

**Example:**
```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    console.log('Error:', error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}

// Usage
function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

In this example, `ErrorBoundary` will catch errors in `MyComponent` or any of its children, preventing the entire app from crashing and displaying a fallback UI instead.

### 9. What is the purpose of the `useImperativeHandle` hook? üéõÔ∏è

The `useImperativeHandle` hook customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using `ref`.

**Novice Explanation:** Imagine you have a fancy remote control üéÆ for a toy. `useImperativeHandle` is like customizing which buttons are on that remote control, deciding exactly what the parent component can do with your component.

**Expert Explanation:** `useImperativeHandle` should be used with `forwardRef`. It allows a child component to expose a custom API to its parent component, instead of exposing the entire instance.

Key points:
1. It's used to customize the value exposed by `ref`.
2. Helps in maintaining encapsulation by exposing only necessary functionalities.
3. Useful when you want to limit the control a parent component has over a child component.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useRef, useImperativeHandle, forwardRef } from 'react';

const FancyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const inputRef = useRef();
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    },
    setValue: (value) => {
      inputRef.current.value = value;
    }
  }));

  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
});

function App() {
  const fancyInputRef = useRef();

  const handleClick = () => {
    fancyInputRef.current.focus();
    fancyInputRef.current.setValue('Hello, World!');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <FancyInput ref={fancyInputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus and Set Value</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `FancyInput` uses `useImperativeHandle` to expose a custom `focus` method and a `setValue` method, rather than exposing the entire input element.

### 10. How do you handle forms in React? üìù

Handling forms in React involves managing form state, handling user input, and controlling form submission.

**Novice Explanation:** Think of form handling in React like filling out a survey üìã. You need to keep track of what people write (manage state), respond when they're writing (handle input), and do something when they submit the survey (form submission).

**Expert Explanation:** There are two main approaches to handling forms in React:

1. **Controlled Components**: The form data is handled by the React component's state.
2. **Uncontrolled Components**: The form data is handled by the DOM itself.

Controlled components are generally preferred as they provide more control and make it easier to modify or validate user input.

Key considerations:
- State management for form fields
- Handling input changes
- Form submission
- Validation
- Handling multiple input types

**Example of a Controlled Form:**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledForm() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    username: '',
    email: '',
    password: ''
  });

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData(prevData => ({
      ...prevData,
      [name]: value
    }));
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Form submitted:', formData);
    // Here you would typically send the data to a server
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        name="username"
        value={formData.username}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Username"
      />
      <input
        type="email"
        name="email"
        value={formData.email}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Email"
      />
      <input
        type="password"
        name="password"
        value={formData.password}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Password"
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

This example demonstrates a controlled form where React manages the state of all form fields. The `handleChange` function updates the state as the user types, and `handleSubmit` processes the form data when the form is submitted.
